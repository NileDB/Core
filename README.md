# NileDB Core

![logo](logo.png)

Welcome to [NileDB](https://niledb.com) Core, an open-source Data Backend written in Java and based on PostgreSQL & GraphQL.

NileDB Core dynamically generates a GraphQL API on top of your PostgreSQL database to let you integrate your front-end apps with your data in an easy, quick, secure, and scalable way.

### Quick Start

You can start experimenting quickly with this basic tutorial.

In order to make it easier to start, we have recorded the tutorial in the following video:

[![Basic Tutorial](video-link.png)](https://youtu.be/W2JlWUOliVM)

You need [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) & [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) installed previously in order to successfully complete this tutorial.

First of all, you need to download the project:

    > git clone https://github.com/NileDB/com.niledb.core.git
    > cd com.niledb.core

Now, you can build the project:

    > ./gradlew build

Once we have built the project, you can deploy two docker containers, one for the database, and the other for the GraphQL API:

    > docker-compose up
    
First time, an empty database will be created. Then, you can open another terminal window and connect to the database:

    > docker exec -it db psql -U postgres niledb

And, create some tables:

    niledb=# create table product (id serial primary key, name text, description text);

You have created a "product" table. Now, you can test GraphQL API. Open a browser in http://localhost and type:

    mutation {
      __reloadSchema
    }

In order to execute GraphQL commands you must click on the play button.

Once GraphQL schema is automatically generated, you can refresh the browser.

Now, you can create some products:

    mutation {
      productCreate (
        entity: {
          name: "Portable Picnic Table"
          description: "Portable folding picnic table with seating for four."
        }
      ) {
        id
        name
        description
      }
    }
    
You can also query your database with different criteria, full-text search, ...:

    query {
      productList(where: {
        description: {SEARCH: {query: "tables & seats"}}
      }) {
        id
        name
        description
      }
    }

Let's create a "category" table and a relation to the "product" table (in your SQL console):

    niledb=# create table category (id serial primary key, name text);
    niledb=# alter table product add column category int;
    niledb=# alter table add constraint category foreign key (category) references category(id);
    
Now, refresh the GraphQL schema:

    mutation {
      __reloadSchema
    }

Once GraphQL schema is automatically generated, you can refresh the browser.

Let's insert a category:

    mutation {
      categoryCreate(entity: {
        name: "Outdoor recreation"
      }) {
        id
        name
      }
    }

Let's modify our products to be in the new category:

    mutation {
      productUpdate(entity: {
          category: 1
        }
        where: {
          id: {EQ: 1}
        }
      ) {
        id
        name
        description
        category
      }
    }

Now, let's query the relation between "product" and "category" in both directions:

    query {
      categoryList {
        id
        name
        products: productListViaCategory {
          id
          name
          description
        }
      }
    }
    
    query {
      productList {
        id
        name
        description
        categoryViaCategory {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }

Feel free to explore the other features (i.e. Sorting results, pagination [limit & offset], different filtering operators, ...).

Finally, you can delete data also:

    mutation {
      productDelete(
        where: {
          id: {EQ: 1}
        }
      ) {
        id
        name
      }
    }

In this short tutorial, we have explored the following NileDB Core features:

* Dynamically generating & evolving GraphQL API.
* Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* Querying relations (JOINs) bi-directionally.
* Full-text search capabilities.

Feel free to give us your feedback in order to improve the available features. Thanks.
